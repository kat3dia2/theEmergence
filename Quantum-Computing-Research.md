## What is Quantum Computing?

"Quantum Computing is the use of quantum phenomina such as superposition and entanglement to perform computing."
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing

"A classical computer encodes information in bits, which can either take the value 0 or 1. 
A quantum computer instead uses a qubit, which physically can be something like a photon or an atom. The qubit can be in the state 0 or 1 (like a classical computer), but also in a superposition of these two states.
Say we have a sequence of three classical bits, then we can only store 1 out of 8 possible numbers at a given time. However if we have a sequence of three qubits, all 8 numbers can be stored in a quantum superposition at the same time.
So our system of three qubits make 8 calculations simultaneously, while the classical computer is only making one."

All of this computing power requires significant cooling however - "Quantum computers need to be kept at temperatures close to absolute zero, which is on the order of -270 degrees Celsius \[to operate correctly]"

## What can Quantum Computing be used for?

Due to the sheer computational power of quantum computing, current encryption standards will be rendered obsolete once quantum computers become more mainstream. They will be able to crack current encryption standards easily when compared to classical computers. Research and testing is currently in progress to create quantum-resistant encryption methods by various agencies around the world. The NSA has created a list of quantum-resistant encryption methods.

Quantum computers will be able to more accurately model and predict the weather. Current weather forecasts created on classical computers are useable, however they take time to create and aren't entirely accurate. Quantum weather models will be able to be created much more quickly and accurately, and with this speed, be able to predict natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes in good time so that areas can be evacuated beforehand.

Machine learning will be significantly sped up with quantum computing. This will allow for the automation of tasks to become much quicker, and through quantum machine learning, more efficent ways will be found much more quickly.

## Is there anything Quantum Computing isn't as good at?

While quantum computing has the potential for many, many exciting advances in the computing world, classical computers that we use today are better at certain things. For example: S
