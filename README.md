## Robotics ( Mining Robots designed for mining water on the moon )
* Every year there is a competetion for schools in America to design and build lunar mining robots
* NASA has already committed to using the company 'Intuative Machines' to launch their first ice mining experiment 'PRIME-1' in 2022
* This experiment will drill samples from the south pole of the moon (wehere ice is theorised to be) and study them with an onboard spectrometer and send the data back to earth.
* This is the first step in NASA's 'Artemis' programme which plans to have astronauts on the moon by 2024.
* If moon ice mining becomes successfull this will be key for future space exploration as water in space is extremely valuable.
* Having water in space means we will be able to create fuel from hydrogen and help sustain life.
* Having Fuel stations in orbit around earth means we will not need as much fuel to exit our atmosphere.
* The programming for theese robotics is very important as for a long time this will have to happen remotely while we are still on earth.
* The cost for theese experimental programmes vastly outweigh the financial gains how-ever this could be a very necessary stepping stone in technology.

## 5G> 
<5G has been described as a "game changer" and there's a lot of information and opinions about it.  Some of it is accurate but a lot if it isn't.>
<#MYTHS VS FACTS>
<MYTH #1:  5g is an untested, new technology.>
<Fact #1:  The technology 5G relies on is not new; it is integral to our lives and is tested in line with strict international safety standards.>
<MYTH #2:  5G is harmful to human health>
<Fact #2:  There is no evidence to suggest 5G is harmful to human health.>
<Myth #3:  5G uses higher frequencies which mens higher radiation levels.>
<Fact #3:  5G will operate using higher frequencies and general lower levels of electromagnetic energy. >
<Myth #4:  Electromagnetic energy is only emitted from telecommunication facilities. >
<Fact #4:  Electromagnitic energy us emitted from a number of natural and artificial sources including but not limited to communications.  >
<Myth #5:  all electomagnetic energy is dangerous.>
<Fact #5:  Some electromagnetic energy may be dangerous in some circumstances but not that used for telecommunications. >
