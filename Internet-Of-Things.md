## Internet of Things:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept where almost everything with access to the internet is connected and can talk to each other.
This goes far beyond the technologies that many people might first assume being capable of communication - smartphones, computers etc - and reaches devices otherwise considered 'dumb' - think toasters, coffee makers and lamps - even to the scale of components within machines such as vehicles, drills on an oil rig or wind turbines.
With all of these 'things' being able to share data with each other, it creates an endless amount of opportunities for how these connections can be used.

"There are many examples for what this might look like or what the potential value might be. Say for example you are on your way to a meeting; your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take. If the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late. What if your alarm clock wakes up you at 6 a.m. and then notifies your coffee maker to start brewing coffee for you? What if your office equipment knew when it was running low on supplies and automatically re-ordered more?" - Forbes

IoT devices are essentially split ionto three categories:

  - Sensors that collect information and send it. -> Think motion, temperature, light, noise - almost anything.
   
  - Computers that receive information and process it. -> What we are most used to - a computer, printer etc
  
  - Devices that do both. -> This is where it gets interesting, take this farming example from iotforall.com:
    
    Sensors collect information about about soil moisture and can tell farmers exactly when and how much the crops need to be watered, the farmer can then adjust the irrigation     system accordingly. With a device capable of processing this information and acting on it, the irrigation system can automatically act on the data it is receiving about soil     moisture and water the crops itself. 
    Or a step further - the irrigation system receives data about the weather from its internet connection, it can know when it is going to rain and decide not to water the         crops when they will be watered with rain anyway.
 
With the advancements in edge computing that are taking place means that devices are becoming increasingly capable of collecting data, processing it at its source, without having to first send it to an intermediary server. This creates a faster, more efficient infrastructure of devices and people that is able to connect to the surrounding environment.
